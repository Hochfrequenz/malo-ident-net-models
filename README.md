# MaLo Ident .NET Models

This repository contains the nuget package `MaLoIdentModels` which contains C# model classes with `System.Text.Json` attributes for the Marktlokation Identification API by EDI@Energy.

It (de)serializes model classes to 100% as required by EDI@Energy (this includes datetimes and enums), but provides you as a developer with strongly typed models instead of stringly typed properties that you'd have to deal with, if you used the official OpenApi spec.

All the JSON serialization settings come out of the box, no manual settings required as long as you use `System.Text.Json`.

## Installation and Use

Install it from nuget [MaLoIdentModels](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaLoIdentModels):

```bash
dotnet add package MaLoIdentModels
```

Then use it

```c#
using MaLoIdentModels.v1;
// ...
var myNegativeResponse = new ResultNegative()
{
   DecisionTree = "E_0594",
   ResponseCode = "A10",
   Reason = "Ich bin ein Freitext.",
   NetworkOperator = 9900987654321
};
var myJson = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(myNegativeResponse);
Console.Out.WriteLine(myJson);
```

### Versioning

For each major version of the OpenAPI spec, a new namespace is created.
The version which is valid from April 2025 onwards is `v1`.

## Why are only parts of the code autogenerated?

The classes are generally based on the [MaLo Ident OpenAPI specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/edi-energy/MaLoIdent_2024-07-03/v1.0.0).
But although auto-generation of code is theoretically possible, the classes are _not_ autogenerated for multiple reasons:

1. The official OpenAPI Spec has several problems. We at Hochfrequenz maintain a better version of the `openapi.yml` without all the shortcomings here: [Hochfrequenz/malo-ident-python-models/openapi/openapi.yml](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/malo-ident-python-models/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yml)
2. (Technical) We wanted to use System.Text.Json in .NET8 (and not Newtonsoft in .NET6) and did not find a a working code generator.
3. We didn't want to deal with magic JsonSettings, so we manually added all JsonPropertyName attributes and JsonConverters where needed.
