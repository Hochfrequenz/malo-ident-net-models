# MaLo Ident .NET Models

This repository contains the nuget package `MaLoIdentModels` which contains C# model classes with `System.Text.Json` attributes for the Marktlokation Identification API by EDI@Energy.

## Installation and Use

Install it from nuget [MaLoIdentModels](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaLoIdentModels):

```bash
dotnet add package MaLoIdentModels
```

Then use it

```c#
using MaLoIdentModels;
// ...
var myNegativeResponse = new ResultNegative()
{
   DecisionTree = "E_0594",
   ResponseCode = "A10",
   Reason = "Ich bin ein Freitext.",
   NetworkOperator = 9900987654321
};
var myJson = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(myNegativeResponse);
Console.Out.WriteLine(myJson);
```

## Why are only parts of the code autogenerated?

The classes are generally based on the [MaLo Ident OpenAPI specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/edi-energy/MaLoIdent_2024-07-03/v1.0.0).
But although auto-generation of code is theoretically possible, the classes are _not_ autogenerated for multiple reasons:

1. The official OpenAPI Spec has several problems. We at Hochfrequenz maintain a better version of the `openapi.yml` without all the shortcomings here: [Hochfrequenz/malo-ident-python-models/openapi/openapi.yml](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/malo-ident-python-models/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yml)
2. (Technical) We wanted to use System.Text.Json in .NET8 (and not Newtonsoft in .NET6) and did not find a a working code generator.
3. We didn't want to deal with magic JsonSettings, so we manually added all JsonPropertyName attributes and JsonConverters where needed.
